## Video 1,2

In Video 1 and 2 an ad hoc agent is collaborating with a human to achive daily household tasks.
The action selection of ad hoc agents enhances team collaboration and prevents conflicts, enabling the agents to achieve their goal more efficiently and within less time.

## Video 3

In Video 3, four agents—three ad hoc agents and one human—collaborate to complete a series of household tasks. The architecture scales efficiently to accommodate a larger number of agents, leading to improved performance.

Each video is recorded from a camera positioned behind each agent, providing a clear view of their tasks. Due to GitHub’s file size limitations, we have uploaded them separately.
