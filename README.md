# Generic-to-Specific Reasoning and Ad Hoc Teamwork in Embodied AI Agents
This repository contains the supplementary files for a hybrid architecture for ad hoc teamwork combining knowledge based reasoning with data-driven learning, while using Large Language Models (LLM) to predict future tasks of the agents.
