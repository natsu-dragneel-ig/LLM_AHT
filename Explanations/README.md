Our architecture enables the ad hoc agent to generate relational descriptions as explanations of its decisions and beliefs and those of the other agents.

We designed different configurations, each with a different arrangement and status of objects in the initial condition, 
e.g., bread on the kitchen table instead of the counter, microwave open instead of closed. 

and measured the ability of the agent to come up with answers to 32 different questions (divided between the four types of questions). 
The precision and recall values of retrieving literals to answer these questions are showed below:

High values of precision and recall indicate the ability to automatically extract the correct literals to provide relational descriptions as explanations in response to different types of questions.
